            <li>Like every cake recipe, this also requires all the ingredients to be at room temperature.</li>
            <li>I used yogurt as my egg-replacement in this recipe. You can also substitute it with same amount of milk plus 2 tsp apple cider or natural vinegar.</li>
            <li>This apple cake takes longer to bake than regular eggless cakes, because of the diced apples in the batter. Bake it until the top is firm, golden and the tester comes out clean.</li>
            <li>It is important to line the baking tray properly, especially if you are using butterscotch chips. They melt during the bake and can stick to the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Patience really is a virtue as far as this cake is concerned. Don’t be tempted to cut it when it is hot or warm. It is soft & crumbly, so it slices well on cooling down completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>INGREDIENTS</b></span>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups of All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 Red Apples (Peeled, Cored & Chopped into 1 inch slices)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Butterscotch Chips</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cinnamon Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>PREPARATION</b></span>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease and line a 6 inch square baking pan to line the baking tray properly, especially if you are using butterscotch chips. They melt during the bake and can stick to the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven at 180°C for 15 mins.</li>
        </ol>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></span>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients – 1.5 cups all purpose flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp cinnamon powder.</li>
            <li>Mix it well and set aside.</li>
            <li>In another mixing bowl add 1/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup fresh yogurt/curd and 1/2 cup sugar.</li>
            <li>Whisk it until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture looks well combined.</li>
            <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and mix it in.</li>
            <li>Now add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture.</li>
            <li>Fold it gently without any lumps.</li>
            <li>Next add the 2 sliced apples and 2 tbsp butterscotch chips.</li>
            <li>Gently fold it in. The cake batter should look glossy & smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the cake batter into a greased and lined baking dish. I placed a few slices of apples and some butterscotch chips on top.</li>
            <li>Bake at 180°C for 40-45mins until the tester comes out cleans. Let the cake cool down completely before cutting it.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla/butterscotch ice cream or along with hot tea/coffee. Store in an airtight container for a week in the fridge.</li>
        </ol>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>NOTES</b></span>
        <ul>
            <li>The cake takes a long time to bake because of the sliced apples. Keep a close eye on the cake after the 40 minute mark and check for done-ness. Depending on the oven temperatures & makes, the baking times could vary.</li>
            <li>It is optional to use butterscotch chips.</li>
            <li>If you are not a fan of cinnamon flavor, increase the vanilla extract to 1tsp and skip cinnamon powder.</li>
        </ul>
