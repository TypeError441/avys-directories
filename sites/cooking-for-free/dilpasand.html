        <ol>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl add 1 tsp active instant dry yeast, 2.5 tbsp sugar and 1/2 cup warm milk. Mix well and let it stand for 5 mins until the yeast is activated.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl add 2 cups all-purpose flour & 1/4 tsp of salt. Mix it well.</li>
            <li>Pour the yeast mixture and roughly mix it with a spoon. Add 1.5 tbsp butter and 2 tsp oil.</li>
            <li>Knead it until the dough is soft, smooth and springy.</li>
            <li>Let it rest for 1-2 hours in a warm place until it has doubled up in volume.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the sweet coconut filling – dry roast 1 cup fresh grated coconut in a pan until it is warm and slightly toasty.</li>
            <li>Add it to a mixing bowl with 1/2 cup tutti frutti, 4-5 finely chopped candied cherries, 8-10 each of roughly broken cashews and almonds with 1 tbsp melted butter.</li>
            <li>Now add 1 tbsp sugar finely powdered along with 1/4 tsp cardamom powder.</li>
            <li>Mix everything well together.</li>
            <li>Now punch down the doubled-up dough and cut it into two parts equally.</li>
            <li>On a baking sheet, roll a part of dough about 7 inch dia of about 1/2 cm thickness.</li>
            <li>Place the prepared sweet coconut mixture at the center, spreading it evenly leaving about 1/2 an inch gap at the edges.</li>
            <li>Now roll the other part of the dough slightly thinner and larger than the first part. I rolled it about 10” in dia.</li>
            <li>Carefully place it over the top of the filling.</li>
            <li>Close & seal the edges tightly.</li>
            <li>Let the prepared bun raise for about 30-45 mins in a warm place and let the dough raise again.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile preheat the oven at 170°C for 20 mins. Once the bun has almost doubled up, make a slit at the center using a sharp knife/blade. Brush the dough with milk.</li>
            <li>Bake at 170°C for 20-25 mins until it is golden brown both at top and bottom. Remove from oven.</li>
            <li>Once cooled down, cut into slices of desired size. Serve warm or cold with a cup of coffee/tea.</li>
        </ol>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>NOTES</b></span>
        <ol>
            <li>Choice of add-ons are as per preference. The cookie wrapper I saved up had mentioned dried papaya, cranberries, almond flakes, coconut flakes, raisins and chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>I had liquid glucose lying around since a couple of months and when I saw that the ingredients contained that, I gladly used it up. But taste wise, it was just like sugar. Honey can be used if liquid glucose is not available.</li>
            <li>If the dough is a little sticky, grease your palms with extra butter.</li>
            <li>Chop up the raisins if they are too big (like mine were), the raisins bulged and changed color as I had put them whole. Helps equally distribute add-ons.</li>
            <li>The cookies would be soft to touch when just out of oven, let them cool down for 5 mins before removing them from the tray for further cooling.</li>
