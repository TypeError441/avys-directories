        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>PREPARATION</b></span>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven at 180°C for 10-15 mins.</li>
        </ol>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></span>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl add 3/4 cups of instant oats along with whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li>Add baking soda, salt and coconut powder/desiccated coconut. Mix well.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, add melted butter followed by cane sugar.</li>
            <li>Mix well until the sugar and butter are well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar mixture to the oats mixture along with liquid glucose/honey, chocolate chips, raisins and vanilla essence.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, mix it really well.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of milk and using fingers, bring the mixture together. Add an additional 1 tbsp of milk as needed and make the cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Make small equal sized balls out of the dough and gently press each ball slightly flat. Place them not too close to each other on the lined baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake it on pre-heated oven at 180°C for 15-20 mins until the cookies are golden. Remove them from oven.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies cool down completely and store them in air tight container. Serve with some milk.</li>
        </ol>
        <span style="padding: 10px; background-color: #d91436; color: #ffffff;"><b>NOTES</b></span>
        <ol>
            <li>Choice of add-ons are as per preference. The cookie wrapper I saved up had mentioned dried papaya, cranberries, almond flakes, coconut flakes, raisins and chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>I had liquid glucose lying around since a couple of months and when I saw that the ingredients contained that, I gladly used it up. But taste wise, it was just like sugar. Honey can be used if liquid glucose is not available.</li>
            <li>If the dough is a little sticky, grease your palms with extra butter.</li>
            <li>Chop up the raisins if they are too big (like mine were), the raisins bulged and changed color as I had put them whole. Helps equally distribute add-ons.</li>
            <li>The cookies would be soft to touch when just out of oven, let them cool down for 5 mins before removing them from the tray for further cooling.</li>
