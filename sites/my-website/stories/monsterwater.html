<body style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">
    <p class="subtitle">It was a normal <span style="color: yellow;">sunny</span> day. It was 8 A.M. I had just woken up to the <b>SCREAMING</b> alarm in the morning.
My wife was cooking breakfast. I had helped a <i>tinsy tiny bit</i> too.<br>
I took a walk around the block.<br>
I walked past the roads, the people, I heard the birds chirping, Ahhh! It was such a beautiful day! And I walked past the lake-<br>
Without my notice, I was dragged into the water. I was held on by my leg.<br>
I tried to swim back up but it was for nothing. The mysterious thing was pulling even faster. <br>
Then, I saw an ice entrance. Was I going insane?
I rubbed my eyes, and looked again. I guess not!
I was dragged into the ice entrance.<br>
First, I was breathing because there was no water,<br>
Then, I saw so many things. A television, table, lamp,<br> everything! But it was all made out of water or ice! I walked carefully.<br>
Finally, I saw an engraving in the ice that said ‘BEWARE OF THE MONSTER’.<br>
I was confused and scared. It said ‘beware’ so I was going to leave but I realized that I can’t because I had no way to.
So I had nothing to do but go in. I mentally prepared myself for some danger.<br>
I went in, and nothing happened. Phew! I kept on walking and walking for an EXTREMELY long time and I collapsed. Finally, when I woke up I looked behind myself. Oh gosh! I could see myself! Then was when I realised that this was never ending.
‘Hello,’ said a deep voice.<br>
'Who are you?' I asked.<br>
'I am the monster of the water,' said the voice.<br>
'The monster of the water?' I said.<br>
'Yes,' answered the monster.<br>
'Why did you bring me here?' I said.<br>
'Because you're being captured!' exclaimed the monster.<br>
Two people came and pulled me to a cage named ‘cage #135’.<br>
'Get in there!' said one servant.<br>
'Yeah!' said the other servant.<br>
'No way!' I answered.<br>
‘Get in there or you'll be a servant!’ exclaimed the monster.<br>
‘There’s not a CHANCE I'm going in there!’ I protested.<br>
‘If you want to do this the hard way, then okay!’ said the monster.
The servants pulled out tridents and cornered me. I had no way to go. I had to go into that awful cage and stay forever.<br>
After the monster left, I heard banging on the door.<br>
‘Who is it?’ I said in a dull tone.<br>
‘Listen, it’s me, the servant.’ he answered.<br>
‘What do you want?’ I asked him in a dull way.<br>
‘There's a secret you can't tell the monster,’ said the servant.<br>
‘What is it?’ I asked.<br>
‘I've actually wanted to defeat the monster, so has the other servant, but, I don't have anything to do that.’ explained the servant.<br>
‘Wait a minute, you have a flashlight! Won’t that melt the monster?’ I asked.<br>
‘Oh yeah! I forgot about that!’ exclaimed the servant.<br>
‘Then we can use it to kill the monster!’ I said.<br>
‘Yeah!’ he said.<br>
‘But wait,’ I said.<br>
‘What?’ he asked.<br>
‘What will we use to leave the chamber?’ I asked.<br>
‘He told me he had a submarine, so we can use that! He exclaimed.<br>
‘Don’t forget the second servant,’ I said.<br>
‘Okay!’ he said<br>
The servant gave me the flashlight and wished me good luck. I pointed the flash light at the bars of the cage and they melted.
Then I escaped and explored the chamber.
I realized that there was a room saying ‘MONSTER’S ROOM’.
I walked in. I saw the monster sleeping and I was ready to melt it. I pulled out the flashlight and turned it on. It worked! The monster was melting! The monster woke up and roared. I was so scared but I had to melt it completely. The monster kept on following me but I was melting it to water. The monster was catching up. I was scared. I was melting it for so long and finally, the monster melted. Then I ran and called saying ‘Servant! Servant!’<br>
The servant came to me and said ‘Yeah?’<br>
‘I beat the monster! It melted!’ I said.<br>
‘Wait really?’ he asked.<br>
‘Yes!’ I answered.<br>
‘Then we can leave!’ he said.<br>
‘Yeah!’ I exclaimed.<br>
‘Okay, I’ll call the other servant!’ he said.<br>
The first servant called the other servant and the other servant came there.<br>
‘Come on let’s go! We have the submarine to leave!’ said the first servant.<br>
‘Okay!’ I said hurriedly.<br>
The servants led me to the submarine and we hopped in.
‘Okay let’s go!’ I said.<br>
We went to the surface of the ravine and finally escaped. It was so amazing to be on firm land again.
I thanked the servants and left back home. It felt so amazing to be on solid land again. As soon as I went home my wife saw me and asked me questions like: What happened? Where were you? Why are you drenched? But I could not answer the question because I was exasperated. I went to my bedroom, changed my clothes and hopped into bed.
