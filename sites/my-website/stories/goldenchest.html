<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br>
<i>I read the newspaper......</i><br>
I was eating breakfast when it was 8 o’ clock. I did not think any extraordinary things would happen (it never does). But sure enough, it would be extraordinary.<br>
I read the newspaper and found something weird. It said that there was a rumor about there being a chest. A <span style= "color: yellow;">GOLDEN CHEST</span> to be exact. I was very excited about this and the newspaper had mentioned the location and the location was a few miles from next to the house! I started packing my stuff and left. It was going to be fun.<br>
<b>CHAPTER 2</b><br>
<i>An adventure......</i><br>
<b>DAY #1</b>
After I left I was feeling good. I was stocked on supplies and I got enough food so I was ready to go. I walked a bit and was tired. I wanted to sleep. I pulled out a sleeping bag. I went in and slept.<br>
<b>DAY #2</b><br>
Once I woke up I ate an omelette and some ham and was ready to adventure more. I walked and walked for about half a mile and it was nighttime again. I pulled out my sleeping bag and slept.<br>
<b>DAY #3</b><br>
Once I woke up I ate my breakfast; cereal and pancakes. I was starting to feel a little nervous about this.
I didn't know if I had the courage to complete this.<br>
<b>DAY #4</b><br>
I ate breakfast and walked even more. It was very tiring. I had nearly reached 1.75 miles. It became nighttime and I slept.<br>
<b>DAY #5</b><br>
I was close to the chest. I knew it. I wanted to find the chest. Suddenly, I saw something. It was yellow and shiny. Was it the golden chest? I rubbed my eyes and looked again. It was still there. Okay then! I guess I found it on the 5th day! That was a very short time. I was very tired so I went to bed.<br>
<b>DAY #6</b><br>
I had found the golden chest but today it wasn’t there! I was very confused but then I saw something. Someone was spying on me! I saw eyes looking directly at me. I pretended to not notice it and walked past the bush he was hiding in. I pulled out a sword that I had packed. The thief was not even prepared. He ran away with the chest. I ran faster than him and snatched the chest out of his hand. I ran with my stuff all the way back home.<br>
I didn’t care how tired I was. I just ran and ran till I came home.<br>
<b>CHAPTER 3</b><br>
<i>Back Home......</i><br>
As soon as I went back I put the golden chest down and tried to open it. The chest wasn’t budging! Then I noticed that there was a keyhole. Was I going to have to get a key as well? I guess I do!
